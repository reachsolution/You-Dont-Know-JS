# You Don't Know JS: Types & Grammar
# Chapter 4: Coercion

Our goal is to fully explore the pros and cons (yes, there *are* pros!) of coercion, so that you can make an informed decision.

## Converting Values

Converting a value from one type to another is often called "type casting," when done explicitly, and "coercion" when done implicitly (forced by the rules of how a value is used).

**Note:** JavaScript coercions always result in one of the scalar primitive values, like `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. There is no coercion that results in a complex value like `object` or `function`.

"implicit coercion" is when the type conversion occur as a less obvious side effect of some other intentional operation.

For example, consider these two approaches to coercion:

```js
var a = 42;

var b = a + "";			// implicit coercion

var c = String( a );	// explicit coercion
```

## Abstract Value Operations

Learn the basic rules that govern how values *become* either a `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. We will specifically pay attention to: `ToString`, `ToNumber`, and `ToBoolean`, and to a lesser extent, `ToPrimitive`.

### `ToString`

When any non-`string` value is coerced to a `string` representation, the conversion is handled by the `ToString` abstract operation 

Built-in primitive values have natural stringification: `null` 		becomes    `"null"`, </br>
							`undefined`     becomes    `"undefined"`, </br>
							`true` 		becomes    `"true"`</br>
							`1`		becomes    `"1"` </br>
very small or very large `numbers` are represented in exponent form:

```js
// multiplying `1.07` by `1000`, seven times over
var a = 1.07 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000;

// seven times three digits => 21 digits
a.toString(); // "1.07e21"
```

For regular objects, unless you specify your own, the default `toString()` will return the *internal `[[Class]]`* - `"[object Object]"`.

If an object has its own `toString()` method on it then its implementaion result will be displayed

Arrays have an overridden default `toString()` that stringifies as `[1,2,3].toString() // "1,2,3"`

#### JSON Stringification


```js
JSON.stringify( 42 );	// "42"
JSON.stringify( "42" );	// ""42"" (a string with a quoted string value in it)
JSON.stringify( null );	// "null"
JSON.stringify( true );	// "true"
```

Any *JSON-safe* value can be stringified by `JSON.stringify(..)`. But what is *JSON-safe*? 


**not** JSON-safe. Some examples: `undefined`s, `function`s, (ES6+) `symbol`s, and `object`s with circular references.

The `JSON.stringify(..)` utility will automatically omit prop if values are `undefined`, `function`, and `symbol`.

Consider:

```js
JSON.stringify( undefined );					// undefined
JSON.stringify( function(){} );					// undefined

JSON.stringify( [1,undefined,function(){},4] );	// "[1,null,null,4]" // it will add null for arrays
JSON.stringify( { a:2, b:function(){} } );		// "{"a":2}"
```

But if you try to `JSON.stringify(..)` an `object` with circular reference(s) in it, an error will be thrown.


If you  have values in the `object` that aren't *JSON-safe*, you should define a `toJSON()` method for it that returns a *JSON-safe* version of the `object`.

For example:

```js
var o = { };

var a = {
	b: 42,
	c: o,
	d: function(){}
};

// create a circular reference inside `a`
o.e = a;

// would throw an error on the circular reference
// JSON.stringify( a );

// define a custom JSON value serialization
a.toJSON = function() {
	// only include the `b` property for serialization
	return { b: this.b };
};

JSON.stringify( a ); // "{"b":42}"
```


`toJSON()` should be interpreted as "to a JSON-safe object," not "to a JSON string" as many developers mistakenly assume.



An optional second argument to `JSON.stringify(..)` called *replacer*. This argument can  be an `array` or a `function`. It's used to customize the recursive serialization of an `object` by providing a filtering mechanism for which properties should and should not be included.


```js
var a = {
	b: 42,
	c: "42",
	d: [1,2,3]
};

JSON.stringify( a, ["b","c"] ); // "{"b":42,"c":"42"}"

JSON.stringify( a, function(k,v){
	if (k !== "c") return v;
} );
// "{"b":42,"d":[1,2,3]}"
```

A third optional argument can also be passed to `JSON.stringify(..)`, called *space*, which is used as indentation for prettier human-friendly output.

```js
var a = {
	b: 42,
	c: "42",
	d: [1,2,3]
};

JSON.stringify( a, null, 3 );
// "{
//    "b": 42,
//    "c": "42",
//    "d": [
//       1,
//       2,
//       3
//    ]
// }"

JSON.stringify( a, null, "-----" );
// "{
// -----"b": 42,
// -----"c": "42",
// -----"d": [
// ----------1,
// ----------2,
// ----------3
// -----]
// }"
```


### `ToNumber`

If any non-`number` value is used in a way that requires it to be a `number`,  `ToNumber` abstract operation is used.

For example, `true` becomes `1` and `false` becomes `0`. `undefined` becomes `NaN`, but (curiously) `null` becomes `0`.

`ToNumber` for a `string` convertst to a number. If it fails, the result is `NaN` 

Objects (and arrays) will first be converted to their primitive value equivalent, and the resulting value (if a primitive but not already a `number`) is coerced to a `number` according to the `ToNumber` rules just mentioned.

To convert to this primitive value equivalent, the `ToPrimitive` abstract operation  will consult the value in question to see if it has a `valueOf()` method. If `valueOf()` is available and it returns a primitive value, *that* value is used for the coercion. If not, but `toString()` is available, it will provide the value for the coercion.

If neither operation can provide a primitive value, a `TypeError` is thrown.



Consider:

```js
var a = {
	valueOf: function(){
		return "42";
	}
};

var b = {
	toString: function(){
		return "42";
	}
};

var c = [4,2];
c.toString = function(){
	return this.join( "" );	// "42"
};

Number( a );			// 42
Number( b );			// 42
Number( c );			// 42
Number( "" );			// 0
Number( [] );			// 0
Number( [ "abc" ] );	// NaN
```

### `ToBoolean`


All of JavaScript's values can be divided into two categories:

1. values that will become `false` if coerced to `boolean`
2. everything else (which will obviously become `true`)

"falsy" values list:

* `undefined`
* `null`
* `false`
* `+0`, `-0`, and `NaN`
* `""`

That's it. If a value is on that list, it's a "falsy" value, and it will coerce to `false` if you force a `boolean` coercion on it.


## Explicit Coercion

*Explicit* coercion refers to type conversions that are obvious and explicit. There's a wide range of type conversion usage that clearly falls under the *explicit* coercion category for most developers.


### Explicitly: Strings <--> Numbers



To coerce between `string`s and `number`s, we use the built-in `String(..)` and `Number(..)` functions (which we referred to as "native constructors" in Chapter 3), but **very importantly**, we do not use the `new` keyword in front of them. As such, we're not creating object wrappers.

Instead, we're actually *explicitly coercing* between the two types:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = String( a );

var c = "3.14";
var d = Number( c );

b; // "42"
d; // 3.14
```

`String(..)` coerces from any other value to a primitive `string` value, using the rules of the `ToString` operation discussed earlier. 

`Number(..)` coerces from any other value to a primitive `number` value, using the rules of the `ToNumber` operation discussed earlier.

I call this *explicit* coercion because in general, it's pretty obvious to most developers that the end result of these operations is the applicable type conversion.

In fact, this usage actually looks a lot like it does in some other statically typed languages.


```js
var a = 42;
var b = a.toString();

var c = "3.14";
var d = +c;

b; // "42"
d; // 3.14
```

Calling `a.toString()` is  explicit. So JS automatically "boxes"  `42` in an object wrapper, so that `toString()` can be called against the object.

`+c` here is showing the *unary operator* form (operator with only one operand) of the `+` operator. Instead of performing mathematic addition (or string concatenation -- see below), the unary `+` explicitly coerces its operand (`c`) to a `number` value.


**Note:** The generally accepted perspective in the open-source JS community is that unary `+` is an accepted form of *explicit* coercion.

Even if you really like the `+c` form, there are definitely places where it can look awfully confusing. Consider:

```js
var c = "3.14";
var d = 5+ +c;

d; // 8.14
```

#### `Date` To `number`

Another common usage of the unary `+` operator is to coerce a `Date` object into a `number`, because the result is the unix timestamp (milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC) representation of the date/time value:

```js
var d = new Date( "Mon, 18 Aug 2014 08:53:06 CDT" );

+d; // 1408369986000
```

The most common usage of this idiom is to get the current *now* moment as a timestamp, such as:

```js
var timestamp = +new Date();
```



I'd recommend skipping the coercion forms related to dates. Use `Date.now()` for current *now* timestamps, and `new Date( .. ).getTime()` for getting a timestamp of a specific *non-now* date/time that you need to specify.

#### The Curious Case of the `~`



Using `~` with `indexOf()` "coerces" (actually just transforms) the value **to be appropriately `boolean`-coercible**:

```js
var a = "Hello World";

~a.indexOf( "lo" );			// -4   <-- truthy!

if (~a.indexOf( "lo" )) {	// true
	// found it!
}

~a.indexOf( "ol" );			// 0    <-- falsy!
!~a.indexOf( "ol" );		// true

if (!~a.indexOf( "ol" )) {	// true
	// not found!
}
```

`~` takes the return value of `indexOf(..)` and transforms it: for the "failure" `-1` we get the falsy `0`, and every other value is truthy.


I find this to be cleaner code than the previous `>= 0` / `== -1` clutter.

##### Truncating Bits

There's one more place `~` may show up in code you run across: some developers use the double tilde `~~` to truncate the decimal part of a `number` (i.e., "coerce" it to a whole number "integer"). It's commonly (though mistakingly) said this is the same result as calling `Math.floor(..)`.



### Explicitly: Parsing Numeric Strings

parseInt() takes string parameter and returns Number if fails NaN, if paramater is not string then coerces to string.Parses left to right char by char if it find any non numeric char it stops and returns the result upto which it parsed.

Consider:

```js
var a = "42";
var b = "42px";

Number( a );	// 42
parseInt( a );	// 42

Number( b );	// NaN
parseInt( b );	// 42
```



**Tip:** `parseInt(..)` has a twin, `parseFloat(..)`, which (as it sounds) pulls out a floating-point number from a string.

Don't forget that `parseInt(..)` operates on `string` values. It makes absolutely no sense to pass a `number` value to `parseInt(..)`. Nor would it make sense to pass any other type of value, like `true`, `function(){..}` or `[1,2,3]`.


### Explicitly: * --> Boolean

`Boolean(..)` (without the `new`, of course!) is an explicit way of forcing the `ToBoolean` coercion:

```js
var a = "0";
var b = [];
var c = {};

var d = "";
var e = 0;
var f = null;
var g;

Boolean( a ); // true
Boolean( b ); // true
Boolean( c ); // true

Boolean( d ); // false
Boolean( e ); // false
Boolean( f ); // false
Boolean( g ); // false
```

While `Boolean(..)` is clearly explicit, it's not at all common or idiomatic.

 `!` negate operator explicitly coerces a value to a `boolean`. The *problem* is that it also flips the value from truthy to falsy or vice versa. So, the most common way JS developers explicitly coerce to `boolean` is to use the `!!` double-negate operator, because the second `!` will flip the parity back to the original:

```js
var a = "0";
var b = [];
var c = {};

var d = "";
var e = 0;
var f = null;
var g;

!!a;	// true
!!b;	// true
!!c;	// true

!!d;	// false
!!e;	// false
!!f;	// false
!!g;	// false
```



## Implicit Coercion

*Implicit* coercion are any type conversions that aren't obvious (to you).



### Implicitly: Strings <--> Numbers

The `+` operator is overloaded to serve the purposes of both `number` addition and `string` concatenation. So how does JS know which type of operation you want to use? Consider:

```js
var a = "42";
var b = "0";

var c = 42;
var d = 0;

a + b; // "420"
c + d; // 42
```

What's different that causes `"420"` vs `42`? It's a common misconception that the difference is whether one or both of the operands is a `string`, as that means `+` will assume `string` concatenation. While that's partially true, it's more complicated than that.

Consider:

```js
var a = [1,2];
var b = [3,4];

a + b; // "1,23,4"
```



If either operand to `+` is a `string`, the operation will be `string` concatenation. Otherwise, it's always numeric addition.

**Note:** A commonly cited coercion gotcha is `[] + {}` vs. `{} + []`, as those two expressions result, respectively, in `"[object Object]"` and `0`. There's more to it, though, and we cover those details in "Blocks" in Chapter 5.

What's that mean for *implicit* coercion?

You can coerce a `number` to a `string` simply by "adding" the `number` and the `""` empty `string`:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = a + "";

b; // "42"
```


The `-` operator is defined only for numeric subtraction, so `a - 0` forces `a`'s value to be coerced to a `number`. `a * 1` or `a / 1` would accomplish the same result, as those operators are also only defined for numeric operations.


### Implicitly: Booleans --> Numbers

I think a case where *implicit* coercion can really shine is in simplifying certain types of complicated `boolean` logic into simple numeric addition. Of course, this is not a general-purpose technique, but a specific solution for specific cases.

Consider:

```js
function onlyOne(a,b,c) {
	return !!((a && !b && !c) ||
		(!a && b && !c) || (!a && !b && c));
}

var a = true;
var b = false;

onlyOne( a, b, b );	// true
onlyOne( b, a, b );	// true

onlyOne( a, b, a );	// false
```

This `onlyOne(..)` utility should only return `true` if exactly one of the arguments is `true` / truthy. It's using *implicit* coercion on the truthy checks and *explicit* coercion on the others, including the final return value.


### Implicitly: * --> Boolean

 *implicit* coercion to `boolean` values, as it's by far the most common and also by far the most potentially troublesome.

But, what sort of expression operations require/force (*implicitly*) a `boolean` coercion?

1. The test expression in an `if (..)` statement.
2. The test expression (second clause) in a `for ( .. ; .. ; .. )` header.
3. The test expression in `while (..)` and `do..while(..)` loops.
4. The test expression (first clause) in `? :` ternary expressions.
5. The left-hand operand (which serves as a test expression -- see below!) to the `||` ("logical or") and `&&` ("logical and") operators.

Any value used in these contexts that is not already a `boolean` will be *implicitly* coerced to a `boolean` using the rules of the `ToBoolean` abstract operation.

### Operators `||` and `&&`


These operators shouldn't even be called "logical ___ operators", accurate would be "operand selector operators."

Why? Because they don't actually result in a *logic* value (aka `boolean`) in JavaScript, as they do in some other languages.

So what *do* they result in? They result in the value of one (and only one) of their two operands. In other words, **they select one of the two operand's values**.

Quoting the ES5 spec from section 11.11:

> The value produced by a && or || operator is not necessarily of type Boolean. The value produced will always be the value of one of the two operand expressions.

Let's illustrate:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = "abc";
var c = null;

a || b;		// 42
a && b;		// "abc"

c || b;		// "abc"
c && b;		// null
```

Both `||` and `&&` operators perform a `boolean` test on the **first operand** (`a` or `c`). If the operand is not already `boolean` (as it's not, here), a normal `ToBoolean` coercion occurs, so that the test can be performed.

For the `||` operator, if the test is `true`, the `||` expression results in the value of the *first operand* (`a` or `c`). If the test is `false`, the `||` expression results in the value of the *second operand* (`b`).

Inversely, for the `&&` operator, if the test is `true`, the `&&` expression results in the value of the *second operand* (`b`). If the test is `false`, the `&&` expression results in the value of the *first operand* (`a` or `c`).



Another way of thinking about these operators:

```js
a || b;
// roughly equivalent to:
a ? a : b;

a && b;
// roughly equivalent to:
a ? b : a;
```


Again, it's not nearly as common for people to author such things. Usually, they'd do `if (a) { foo(); }` instead. But JS minifiers choose `a && foo()` because it's much shorter. So, now, if you ever have to decipher such code, you'll know what it's doing and why.

OK, so `||` and `&&` have some neat tricks up their sleeve, as long as you're willing to allow the *implicit* coercion into the mix.


### Symbol Coercion

Symbols introduce a gotcha into the coercion system that we need to discuss briefly. For reasons that go well beyond the scope of what we'll discuss in this book, *explicit* coercion of a `symbol` to a `string` is allowed, but *implicit* coercion of the same is disallowed and throws an error.

Consider:

```js
var s1 = Symbol( "cool" );
String( s1 );					// "Symbol(cool)"

var s2 = Symbol( "not cool" );
s2 + "";						// TypeError
```

`symbol` values cannot coerce to `number` at all (throws an error either way), but strangely they can both *explicitly* and *implicitly* coerce to `boolean` (always `true`).


## Loose Equals vs. Strict Equals


If you want coercion, use `==` loose equality, but if you don't want coercion, use `===` strict equality.

**Note:** The implication here then is that both `==` and `===` check the types of their operands. The difference is in how they respond if the types don't match.


#### Safely Using Implicit Coercion

The most important advice I can give you: examine your program and reason about what values can show up on either side of an `==` comparison. To effectively avoid issues with such comparisons, here's some heuristic rules to follow:

1. If either side of the comparison can have `true` or `false` values, don't ever, EVER use `==`.
2. If either side of the comparison can have `[]`, `""`, or `0` values, seriously consider not using `==`.

In these scenarios, it's almost certainly better to use `===` instead of `==`, to avoid unwanted coercion. Follow those two simple rules and pretty much all the coercion gotchas that could reasonably hurt you will effectively be avoided.

**Being more explicit/verbose in these cases will save you from a lot of headaches.**

## Abstract Relational Comparison

While this part of *implicit* coercion often gets a lot less attention, it's important nonetheless to think about what happens with `a < b` comparisons (similar to how we just examined `a == b` in depth).

The "Abstract Relational Comparison" algorithm in ES5 section 11.8.5 essentially divides itself into two parts: what to do if the comparison involves both `string` values (second half), or anything else (first half).

**Note:** The algorithm is only defined for `a < b`. So, `a > b` is handled as `b < a`.

The algorithm first calls `ToPrimitive` coercion on both values, and if the return result of either call is not a `string`, then both values are coerced to `number` values using the `ToNumber` operation rules, and compared numerically.

For example:

```js
var a = [ 42 ];
var b = [ "43" ];

a < b;	// true
b < a;	// false
```

**Note:** Similar caveats for `-0` and `NaN` apply here as they did in the `==` algorithm discussed earlier.

However, if both values are `string`s for the `<` comparison, simple lexicographic (natural alphabetic) comparison on the characters is performed:

```js
var a = [ "42" ];
var b = [ "043" ];

a < b;	// false
```

`a` and `b` are *not* coerced to `number`s, because both of them end up as `string`s after the `ToPrimitive` coercion on the two `array`s. So, `"42"` is compared character by character to `"043"`, starting with the first characters `"4"` and `"0"`, respectively. Since `"0"` is lexicographically *less than* than `"4"`, the comparison returns `false`.

The exact same behavior and reasoning goes for:

```js
var a = [ 4, 2 ];
var b = [ 0, 4, 3 ];

a < b;	// false
```

Here, `a` becomes `"4,2"` and `b` becomes `"0,4,3"`, and those lexicographically compare identically to the previous snippet.

What about:

```js
var a = { b: 42 };
var b = { b: 43 };

a < b;	// ??
```

`a < b` is also `false`, because `a` becomes `[object Object]` and `b` becomes `[object Object]`, and so clearly `a` is not lexicographically less than `b`.

But strangely:

```js
var a = { b: 42 };
var b = { b: 43 };

a < b;	// false
a == b;	// false
a > b;	// false

a <= b;	// true
a >= b;	// true
```

Why is `a == b` not `true`? They're the same `string` value (`"[object Object]"`), so it seems they should be equal, right? Nope. Recall the previous discussion about how `==` works with `object` references.

But then how are `a <= b` and `a >= b` resulting in `true`, if `a < b` **and** `a == b` **and** `a > b` are all `false`?

Because the spec says for `a <= b`, it will actually evaluate `b < a` first, and then negate that result. Since `b < a` is *also* `false`, the result of `a <= b` is `true`.

That's probably awfully contrary to how you might have explained what `<=` does up to now, which would likely have been the literal: "less than *or* equal to." JS more accurately considers `<=` as "not greater than" (`!(a > b)`, which JS treats as `!(b < a)`). Moreover, `a >= b` is explained by first considering it as `b <= a`, and then applying the same reasoning.

Unfortunately, there is no "strict relational comparison" as there is for equality. In other words, there's no way to prevent *implicit* coercion from occurring with relational comparisons like `a < b`, other than to ensure that `a` and `b` are of the same type explicitly before making the comparison.

Use the same reasoning from our earlier `==` vs. `===` sanity check discussion. If coercion is helpful and reasonably safe, like in a `42 < "43"` comparison, **use it**. On the other hand, if you need to be safe about a relational comparison, *explicitly coerce* the values first, before using `<` (or its counterparts).

```js
var a = [ 42 ];
var b = "043";

a < b;						// false -- string comparison!
Number( a ) < Number( b );	// true -- number comparison!
```

## Review

In this chapter, we turned our attention to how JavaScript type conversions happen, called **coercion**, which can be characterized as either *explicit* or *implicit*.

Coercion gets a bad rap, but it's actually quite useful in many cases. An important task for the responsible JS developer is to take the time to learn all the ins and outs of coercion to decide which parts will help improve their code, and which parts they really should avoid.

*Explicit* coercion is code which is obvious that the intent is to convert a value from one type to another. The benefit is improvement in readability and maintainability of code by reducing confusion.

*Implicit* coercion is coercion that is "hidden" as a side-effect of some other operation, where it's not as obvious that the type conversion will occur. While it may seem that *implicit* coercion is the opposite of *explicit* and is thus bad (and indeed, many think so!), actually *implicit* coercion is also about improving the readability of code.

Especially for *implicit*, coercion must be used responsibly and consciously. Know why you're writing the code you're writing, and how it works. Strive to write code that others will easily be able to learn from and understand as well.
